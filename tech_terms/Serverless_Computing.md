# Intro
Serverless computing is a method of providing BackEnd Services as on an-used basis. A serverless code allows you to run your code while not worrying for the underlying infra.

Let's say we are using AWS. Now following are the problems.
1. You will still need to install/update the OS, come up with the rules for when/how the number of servers need to be changed.
2. You also need to keep some spare servers, as it will take several minutes to get your server up and running, if they traffic peaks up.

*** Serverless ***
1. Renting computing power as needed.
